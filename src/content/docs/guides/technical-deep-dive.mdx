title: Technical Deep Dive
description: How it works
---

Customers often ask us if going with Diploi will result in vendor lock-in. 
We think it is quite the opposite, but in order to make our point, first a 
short technical description of how Diploi works.

To begin with, starting a deployment in Diploi will internally launch a private 
Kubernetes cluster. It's not something you need to know about but to understand
how things work it could be useful. When the cluster starts it will launch all 
services you have selected and after that, monitor and control them until you 
close your cluster (eg. by pausing or deleting your deployment).

#### Templates

But how does Diploi know what services to launch? The answer is templates.
Every deployment has a template that describes services, repositories, hosts, 
storage etc. The kubernetes setup is handled with standard helm charts. In fact
all the specifications for our public templates are available to see 
on GitHub at https://github.com/diploi.

In the future we want customers to be able to build and maintain their own 
templates, allowing for an endless possibility of services to be mixed and 
matched. If you have need for this already now, we might be able to work 
something out, please contact us at info@diploi.com.

#### Builds, CI/CD and Images

With Diploi you don't need to setup build pipelines, host images of your
containers or think about CI/CD, but how does this actually work.

The normal way of starting a Diploi project is to let Diploi create the 
GitHub repository for you. In that process Diploi will also set up GitHub
actions that will handle image builds when pushing to that repository.

These images are pushed to an image repository hosted by us in order to 
make images as fast as possible when launching deployments.

If you want to make modifications to the application container you have 
full power to control the image created in your own github repository, so
you are not restricted to the images dockerfiles we provide as starting 
points.

But in order to make remote development, deployment statuses etc. work 
there are certain things that need to be in place. We will provide more 
documentation on how these things work as the Diploi service matures.

#### So What About That Vendor Lock-in

So Diploi is running on pretty standard kubernetes, with publicly available
helm charts and Dockerfiles for the containers. Using all this together
with the code you host yourself on GitHub should not make it too hard
to move your project to Google Cloud, Amazon EKS, Azure or any other
kubernetes.

Sure it will require some level of work, but should not be too difficult for
a kubernetes expert.
