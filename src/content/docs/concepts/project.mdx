### What is a Diploi Project?

A Diploi project contains the deployments of your application. A typical
setup could be one deployment for production, one for staging and perhaps
one development instance per active developer. A project also connects to
a GitHub repository and contains common settings and environment variables.

### Templates

Every project is started from a project template that defines the
infrastructure of your project. There are templates for common
frameworks and languages such as Node, PHP etc. In addition templates
might support databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL and other infrastructure
like ElastiCache, Redis etc.

We provide a set of ready to go templates, and you can have options to enable or
disable certain features.
In a later version of Diploi we want to give you the
option to create your own templates.

### Features of a Project

##### Name

The project name can be chosen freely but will be used as a template for both deployment
names and hostnames so choosing a good short one can be a good idea.

##### Options

Depending on the template there might be some configurable options. E.g. if a database
should be running, Redis enabled etc. Values provided in the project are defaults that
you can override in the deployment.

##### Environment Values

For your project specific configurations and secrets, you can add environment values.
Values provided in the project are defaults that you can override in the actual
deployment.

##### Domain

You can set a default domain for your projects. This will be used as a base domain for all
hosts created in your projects. Diploi will provide you with a default hostname but you
can change it later if you want to use your own domain
(see [Guides / Custom Domain](/guides/custom-domain)).

##### Repository

The easiest way to set up a project is to let Diploi bootstrap a new GitHub repository for
you. This will ensure that the repository contains the right files to make the project run.

Optionally you can create the project by connecting it to an existing repository. This can be
useful for example if you want to share a repository between multiple cores or projects.
In this case however, you are responsible for ensuring that the repository is set up for the
chosen project type.

### Deleting a project

When you no longer need a Project it can be deleted. However you need to delete all deployments
first and wait for the deletion to complete.
