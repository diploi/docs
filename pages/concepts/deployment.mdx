# Deployment

### What is a Diploi Deployment?

In Diploi, a diployment is a full instance of your application, including databases and
other services. It also includes storage and current code changes you are working on.

Deployment can be divided into dynamic development deployments and built deployments
such as testing / staging / production. The main difference is that development
deployments will have persisted storage for your code so that code changes will
remain even if the service restart etc. For build deployments the containers will
start fresh on every restart and run the built production version of your
application. How this works can in part depend on how the project template works
so make sure to check the project template documentation.

### Hosts

Diploi will by default create a public endpoint for your application and generate
a SSL certificate. If you want to use your own domain please see the
[Custom domain](/guides/custom-domain) guide.

### Connecting using ssh

Normally there are three types of deployments:

- Host + DNS

- Connecting

  - Ssh directly

- Remote connection

  - VSCode

- Branch + how it affects (prod + ci/cd etc.)

- Logs + Actions

- Status...

- Cloning

- Env+Params

- Delete
