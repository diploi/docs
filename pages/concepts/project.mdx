# Project

### What is a Diploi project?

A Diploi project contains the deployments of your application, like
production, staging and perhaps several development instances. A project
connects to a GitHub repository and contains common
settings and environment variables.

### Templates

Every project is started from a project template that defines the 
infrastructure of your project. There are templates for common 
frameworks and languages such as Node, PHP etc. In addition templates 
might support databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL and other infrastructure
like ElastiCache, Redis etc.

We have a set of ready to go templates, in a later version of Diploi we
want to give you the option to create your own templates.

### Features of a Project

##### Name

The project name can be chosen freely but will be used as a template for both deployment 
names and hostnames so choosing a good short one can be a good idea.

##### Options

Depending on the template there might be some configurable options. E.g. if a database
should be running, Redis enabled etc. Values provided in the project are defaults that
you can override in the deployment.

##### Environment Values

For your project specific configurations and secrets you can add environment values.
Values provided in the project are defaults that can be overridden in the deployment.


##### Domain

You can set a default domain for you project. This will be used as a base domain for all 
hosts created in your projects. Diploi will provide you with a default hostname but you
can change it later if you e.g. want to use you own domain 
(see [Guides / Custom Domain](/guides/custom-domain))

##### Repository


### Deleting a project

When you no longer need a Project it can be deleted. However you need to delete all deployments first and wait for the deletion to complete.
