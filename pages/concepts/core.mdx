### What is a Diploi Core?

Diploi Core is the underlying computing infrastructure that powers your workloads on Diploi.
It takes cares of running deployments of your application, provides persistent storage and
takes care of SSL certificates etc.

Internally a Core runs it's own fully managed Kubernetes cluster, but don't worry, you don't need to know
anything about Kubernetes in order to use Diploi.

### How do I launch a Diploi Core?

Launching a Diploi Core is easy. Simply click on the Core icon in the top bar and select "Setup Core".
If you are on the Free plan, there is only one size of Core to choose from and it will be preselected,
so you can just click "Launch Diploi Core". If you are on a paid plan, you can choose from different
Core sizes based on your needs.

After a Core is launched it can be paused and restarted. When restarted you can choose for how long
the Core should run 1h, 8h and Forever. Time based Cores are terrific way of saving cost on projects
you touch only now and then.

### What does it cost?

**In the free plan - it's free!** But you are limited to running a single small size core only, and
you can keep it running for a maximum of 8 hours before it automatically stops.

**In the paid plan** - You can run a Core forever, but then you will pay per minute you keep it
running. See the [pricing page](https://www.diploi.com/pricing). Note! You can still run a
single small size core for free if you start it with a time limit, as on the free plan.

### Deleting a Core

When you no longer need a Core it can be deleted. However you need to delete all projects and deployments first.
