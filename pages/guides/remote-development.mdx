# Remote Development

At the heart of Diploi lies remote development,
allowing you to easily work on any of your projects without the need for software installation or maintenance on your local machine,
or dealing with containers.
With just a single button press, you can begin your work without hassle.

You only need two things locally to get up and running:
- [An SSH key](./add-ssh-key.mdx)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or any terminal based / remote supported IDE)

## VS Code

We recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for remote development, but you can use any IDE which supports connecting remotely via SSH.

#### Connecting

Once you have created a deployment, simply click the "Open in VS Code" button visible on the "Overview" tab.  
If you do not have the remote development extension installed, VS Code will prompt you to install it.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you are developing on a Windows machine, VS Code might ask for the type of machine you are connecting to. When using an official Diploi template, you should always select "Linux".

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If you are developing on a Windows machine with WSL enabled, please note that a Windows VS Code install uses SSH keys on your **Windows** user by default.
</Callout>

#### Configuration

Your local VS Code configuration will be used for all remote environments, but certain features (like extensions) need to be configured on a per-deployment basis.

## Other IDEs

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Diploi currently has built in persistent configuration for VS Code only. This means that you will have to configure/install your other IDE again after a deployment upgrade.
</Callout>

Diploi supports any IDE capable of conneting to a remote machine via SSH. This includes terminal based IDEs like Vim.

#### Terminal Based IDEs

Simply open an SSH connection to your deployment, and install your favorite IDE.
