# Custom Domain

Diploi offers the flexibility to configure custom domains on two levels: at the project level and at the deployment level.

## Project

At the project level, you can configure a custom domain that will serve as the base domain for all autogenerated subdomains on deployments.
This means that any new subdomains created on a deployment will automatically use the custom domain as their base domain name.
For example, if you configure "mycompany.com" as the custom domain at the project level,
all autogenerated subdomains will be created as subdomains of "mycompany.com" (e.g. "app-production.mycompany.com", "app-development.mycompany.com", etc.).

## Deployment

In addition to configuring custom domains at the project level,
Diploi also allows you to specify individual hosts that point to a custom domain on a per-deployment basis.
This provides more fine-grained control over your domain configuration,
and enables you to override the autogenerated subdomains created at the project level.
