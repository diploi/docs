# Get Started

Ready to try out Diploi, this section will show how to set up a Next.js TODO App together with a Postgresql database.

  Please note: Diploi is currently invite only. If you are interested in trying it out please contact us at

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Text Editor - We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Create an account

To get started you need a Diploi account. Since Diploi is tightly integrated
with GitHub go to [pilot.diploi.dev](http://pilot.diploi.dev) and
authenticate using your GitHub account.

### Launch a Core

In order to run your deployments you need some computing power, for that we will launch a Core.
Internally a Core is a kubernetes cluster, but don't worry, you don't need to know anyhting about
Kubernetes in order to use Diploi. You can think of a Core as storage and computing power to
run your workloads on.

import Image from 'next/image';

<Image src="/create-core.png" alt="Hello" width={800} height={800} />

If you have a Free plan there is only one size of Cores to choose and it will be
preselected, so you can just click **Launch Core**.

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs';

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The only difference between a paid and a Free Core is that a Free Core only will stay on for 8 hours, after that you need to manually log
  in and restart it.
