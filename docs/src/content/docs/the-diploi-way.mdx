title: The Diploi Way
description: The philosophy behind Diploi - Own your Stack, Infrastructure as Code and Remote Development
---


Diploi is based on the three simple principles


#### 1. Own your Stack

**Keep as much of your project's tech stack inside Diploi as possible so development matches production.**

<details>
<summary><strong>Why?</strong></summary>

In the beginning it's tempting to add third-party services to your solution (cloud databases, caching, 
object-storage, analytics). As teams members and environments (dev, test, staging, prod)
multiply, you will need to address how these tools integrate to different deployments. You will need 
to create instances of the services for each deployment, or leave out or share the data between 
instances, possibly causing issues. Centralizing common components in Diploi keeps environments
repeatable and disposable.

###### Benefits

1. **Environment parity** - All deployments behave the same, 
   fever "works on my machine" issues.
2. **Clonable environments** - Spin up a new environment by cloning another (eg. prod), including 
   databases and other components.
3. **Cost control** - Stop environments when not in use to reduce costs. No need to run test 
   environments 24/7, just start them when needed.
4. **Less DevOps** needed to bring up and down complete environments in seconds

###### When to deviate
- A specialized external service is worth the integration overhead.  
- Diploi doesn't (yet) support a component you need.  
- You require scale/features beyond what Diploi currently offers.

#### 2. Infrastructure as Code

**Keep all your code in one place, structure your project as a monorepo. Keep the tech stack 
configuration as part of your project.**

<details>
<summary><strong>Why?</strong></summary>

Keeping the infrastructure configuration of a project together with other source code is 
a good way of having the complete solution under one single roof. Architecture changes will 
happen automatically, along with code changes as code is committed. In Diploi the building
blocks of your solution is stored inside `diploi.yaml` (think “`package.json` for infra”).

While preferences differ, many now prefer to structure their code as a monorepo. 
Diploi encourages this and uses a default setup where the code for each infra component 
by default lives in a separate folder.

###### Benefits

1. **Visibility & collaboration** - The whole system is versioned and reviewable alongside the app.
2. **Atomic updates** - One PR can change app code, services, and config together. 
3. **Easy DevOps** - Modifying the tech stack is easy, just add a few lines to `diploi.yaml`, press save and 
   in a few seconds you'll have eg. a new database attached to you service. Hot reload for architecture 🤩.

</details>

#### 3. Remote Development

**Develop in the cloud, with zero local setup.**

<details>
<summary><strong>Why?</strong></summary>

Local environments drift, especially across multiple projects. Cloud development gives every 
contributor a fresh, project-correct toolchain and data snapshot. No more 
"which Node/Postgres/CLI do I need for this repo?"

In Diploi you either develop using our in-browser editor or using your local IDE, 
but over SSH (Cursor, VSCode, Windsurf, Zed, etc.). You will be able to use all your 
AI tools and vibe-coding tricks just like you are used to.

###### Upside

1. **Correct by default** - Everyone always have the tools and version for the project you 
   are working on.
2. **No setup time** - Skip local installs, SDKs, and data seeding. New developers are productive in minutes.
3. **Consistent debugging** - Same environment as preview/staging reduces “works locally” issues.

###### Trade-offs

- **Connectivity:** Unreliable or no internet is a blocker. Most IDEs handle flaky connections well, but fully offline work isn't possible
- **Ergonomics:** If you once in a while need fully local coding, you can of course still clone locally.
