In cases when you need to copy an entire deployment with the exact same configuration and database, such as cases when you need to work on a new feature branch that would involve changes to your database, you can use the clone feature to duplicate a deployment.

***

## Cloning a Deployment

To clone a deployment, from the deployment's dashboard, go to the tab **Options** and scroll to the bottom of the page.

`https://console.diploi.com/<your account>/project/<project id>/deployment/<deployment id>/options`

Look for the **Clone Deployment** section, and there you can click on the **Clone this deployment** button to launch the deployment cloning wizard, which is very similar to the deployment creation workflow.

:::note[Keep in mind]
During the process of cloning, you will be unable to make changes to the deployment.

### Assigning a Deployment Type

When cloning a deployment, you can also change its stage. So you could clone a Production deployment and then create a clone deployment intended for Development, using your Production data.

For more information about the types of deployment stages, check [this article, which explains the differences between each type](/reference/deployments/deployment-lifecycle#deployment-stage).

:::note
When you create a new development deployment, it will be active for 12 hours, after which it will be automatically shut down to avoid unnecessary costs. For staging and production deployments, they are not started with a time limit, and will remain active until you shut them down manually.

### Selecting the Deployment Size

After assigning the stage for the cloned deployment, you can choose the size that the deployment should have. The available deployment sizes include:

<DeploymentSizesAndPricing/>

### Configuring Environment Variables

Clone deployments inherit their Env values from the source deployment, which you can modify before launching the deployment.

<ImageToPNG src={DeploymentEnvVars} alt="Environment variables for a cloned deployment"/>

### Launching a Cloned Deployment

Once you have finished configuring the type and size of the deployment, along with modifying any environment variables, you are ready to launch by clicking on "Clone Deployment" which can be found at the bottom of the clone creation wizard.

:::note
There's no difference between cloned and non-cloned deployments in terms of how they operate. So you can expect it to behave exactly as any other deployment.
