Diploi offers the flexibility to configure custom domains on two levels: at the **project** level and at the **deployment** level.

## Project

At the project level, you can configure a custom `diploi.app` subdomain that will serve as the base domain for all autogenerated subdomains on deployments.

Any new deployment created will automatically use the project's domain as their base domain name.

For example, if you configure `mycompany.diploi.app` as the custom domain at the project level,
all autogenerated subdomains will be created as subdomains of `mycompany.diploi.app` (e.g. `app-production.mycompany.diploi.app`, `app-development.mycompany.diploi.app`, etc.).

## Deployment

If you want to use a custom domain, eg. `mycompany.com` you can do it by defining a custom domain for a deployment.

This provides more fine-grained control over your domain configuration and enables you to override the autogenerated subdomains created at the project level.

### Configuring a Custom Subdomain

e.g. `app.example.com`

All you need to do is:

<Steps>
    1. Access your domain DNS records.
    2. Create a new CNAME record, pointing to `edge.diploi.me` and using for name, the subdomain you want to use.
    3. Add your custom domain in your Project or Deployment.

</Steps>

:::note
Depending on your domain hosting service, the configuration above might use different terminology.

### Configuring a Custom Root Domain

e.g. `example.com`

Root domains (also called apex or base domains) do not officially support CNAME records, which Diploi needs.
Many DNS providers offer similar functionality with custom record types like ALIAS or ANAME.   
To point an apex domain to Diploi, you should refer to your DNS providers own instructions.   
We have created a table which lists the recommended records to use with some of the most popular DNS providers:

| Provider      | Record  | Value            |
| ------------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| Cloudflare    | CNAME   | `edge.diploi.me` |
| Namecheap     | ALIAS   | `edge.diploi.me` |
| easyDNS       | ANAME   | `edge.diploi.me` |
| PointDNS      | ALIAS   | `edge.diploi.me` |
| DNS Made Easy | ANAME   | `edge.diploi.me` |
| DNSimple      | ALIAS   | `edge.diploi.me` |
| DreamHost     | ALIAS   | `edge.diploi.me` |

:::note
Depending on the DNS provider, an empty or `@` value usually identifies the root domain.
So instead of adding a record for `example.com`, it might need to be added to `@` e.g.

If your DNS provider only supports A records for root domains, please react out to us.
We can offer assistance with configuration.
