Diploi utilizes SSH keys for user authentication when establishing SSH connections to deployments.
This authentication method is commonly employed for remote development connections, such as those established through VS Code.

To add an SSH key to your Diploi profile, you must:

- Generate an SSH key pair
- Copy the public SSH key
- Add the copied content of your public SSH in Diploi

That's it ðŸ™‚

Let's go through each step in detail.

## Generate a new SSH Key pair

<Tabs syncKey="os">
  <TabItem label="Linux">
   <Steps>
   1. Open a terminal and run: `ssh-keygen` which generates by default an ed25519 key pair
   2. You will get a message, asking you to assign a name for the key pair
      ```bash
      Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
      Enter file in which to save the key (/home/<your_username>/.ssh/id_ed25519): 
      ```
   3. After that, you will be prompted to add a passphrase.
      ```bash
      Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
      Enter the same passphrase again: 
      ```
   4. Now your new key pair is ready, you will see the following message:
      ```bash
      Your identification has been saved in <your_keypair_name>
      Your public key has been saved in someKey.pub
      The key fingerprint is:
      SHA256:gBVtt/m4zes+/0SZPkd+1wwo <your_username>@<your_username>
      The key's randomart image is:
      +--[ED25519 256]--+
      |        o..      |
      |       o   .     |
      |      . .   .    |
      |     . o  o.    .|
      |      . S .=   o.|
      |     o   o= o . B|
      |  . o o .o.E  .=*|
      |   =.+o+..o +..=o|
      |  .+B*=..  . ooo+|
      +----[SHA256]-----+
      ```
   </Steps>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
   <Steps>
   1. Using Git Bash, Terminal or WSL run: `ssh-keygen` which generates by default an ed25519 key pair
   2. You will get a message, asking you to assign a name for the key pair
      ```bash
      Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
      Enter file in which to save the key (/home/<your_username>/.ssh/id_ed25519): 
      ```
   3. After that, you will be prompted to add a passphrase.
      ```bash
      Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
      Enter the same passphrase again: 
      ```
   4. Now your new key pair is ready, you will see the following message:
      ```bash
      Your identification has been saved in <your_keypair_name>
      Your public key has been saved in someKey.pub
      The key fingerprint is:
      SHA256:gBVtt/m4zes+/0SZPkd+1wwo <your_username>@<your_username>
      The key's randomart image is:
      +--[ED25519 256]--+
      |        o..      |
      |       o   .     |
      |      . .   .    |
      |     . o  o.    .|
      |      . S .=   o.|
      |     o   o= o . B|
      |  . o o .o.E  .=*|
      |   =.+o+..o +..=o|
      |  .+B*=..  . ooo+|
      +----[SHA256]-----+
      ```

## Copy the public key generated

<Tabs syncKey="os">
  <TabItem label="Linux">
   <Steps>
      1. ssh-keygen generates two files, one with an extension `.pub` and the other without any extension, eg. `someKey.pub` and `someKey`. The one we need right now is `someKey.pub`, which is your public key. You need to copy the contents of your `.pub` file. You can use the `cat` command:
         ```bash
         cat someKey.pub
         ```
      2. By using `cat` you will print the content of the `someKey.pub` file, it will look like this:
         ```bash
         ssh-ed25519 AA786grtyreugigyuwifewy65643354qWrjhBLtBSewyweRTIZw5DqD0zj <your_username>@<your_username>
         ```
         All you need to do is copy the entire output.

## Add your public key in Diploi

Now that you copied the contents of your public key, you need to add it to your Diploi profile:
<Steps>
   1. Go to [your profile settings](https://console.diploi.com/settings)
   2. Select "Add new SSH key".
   3. Provide a description for your key, such as "Work MacBook," to help you remember its origin or purpose.
   4. Paste your SSH "public key" into the designated field.
   5. Click the "Add SSH Key" button.

:::caution
Never share your SSH private key with anyone! This key grants access to any
deployment you have privileges for, allowing others to authenticate as you.

That's it! Now you can access your deployments using SSH
