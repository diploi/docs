Diploi offers the flexibility to configure custom domains on two levels: at the project level and at the deployment level.

## Project

At the project level, you can configure a custom domain that will serve as the base domain for all autogenerated subdomains on deployments.

This means that any new subdomains created on a deployment will automatically use the custom domain as their base domain name.

For example, if you configure `mycompany.com` as the custom domain at the project level,
all autogenerated subdomains will be created as subdomains of `mycompany.com` (e.g. `app-production.mycompany.com`, `app-development.mycompany.com`, etc.).

## Deployment

In addition to configuring custom domains at the project level,Diploi also allows you to specify individual hosts that point to a custom domain on a per-deployment basis.

This provides more fine-grained control over your domain configuration, and enables you to override the autogenerated subdomains created at the project level.

## How to setup a custom domain

For both case, Projects and Deployments, all you need to do is:

<Steps>
    1. Access your domain DNS records.
    2. Create a new CNAME record, pointing to `edge.diploi.com` and using for name, the subdomain or root domain you want to use.
    3. Add your custom domain in your Project or Deployment.

</Steps>

Depending on your domain hosting service, the configuration above might use different terminology.
