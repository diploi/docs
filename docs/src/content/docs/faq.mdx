## Getting Started

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use Diploi for production applications?</strong></summary>

Yes! Diploi supports production deployments with proper resource allocation, custom domains, and SSL certificates. 
We provide enterprise-grade infrastructure suitable for production workloads. 

However, our single-node kubernetes version does not scale infinitely so to support very busy sites Diploi might not 
yet be the perfect solution. We are hard at work on a more scalable version. See the [roadmap](/roadmap/) for more details.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How much does Diploi cost?</strong></summary>

Check our [pricing page](https://diploi.com/pricing) for current pricing information. We offer different 
tiers to suit various needs, including 100% free trial of the full Diploi experience.

Generally speaking Diploi is very affordable when used for development (4€/deployment/month and upward), 
since you only run the clusters while you are working. A typical production cluster starts from around 
20€/month, when you consider that the same cluster can run both your frontend, backend and database we 
think it can be considered very affordable.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need a GitHub account?</strong></summary>

Yes, Diploi requires GitHub integration because it creates repositories for your projects and handles CI/CD builds 
through GitHub actions. This ensures version control and seamless collaboration.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I try Diploi without registering?</strong></summary>

Yes! You can use launch a trial without registration. Visit [diploi.com/#StackBuilder](https://diploi.com/#StackBuilder) 
to start a deployment in seconds. Deployments launched without registration expire after 12 hours 
but you can claim the account and continue working.

Diploi will automatically rebuild and redeploy your application to the deployments
following that branch. It will also consider changes in infrastructure by looking at

the code part through the editor.
