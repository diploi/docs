## Diploi in a Nutshell

Diploi's mission is to make deployment into a process that you do not need to think about. Our goal is for you to just focus on the code that defines your app, without worrying about SSL certificates, setting up CI/CD pipelines and other commonly cursed devops demons.

We made it possible with a simple architecture to define a new application. In Diploi, you start by first creating a **Project**. A project is the basic building block of your new application. Inside your **Project**, you define the elements that will power your application.

There are two types of elements that are part of your **Project**,

- **Components**, which are the elements that will be exposed for users to access them. These can be frontend, backend or fullstack, and inside of a project you can have multiple components running at the same time as a monorepo
- **Add-ons**, which are elements that will be accesible to your components only. These can be databases, cache servers, message queues, etc.

  <Image src={ProjectStructure} alt='Project components and add-ons available'/>
</div>

:::note
You can have as many components and add-ons in your project as you want ðŸ™‚

To make the following explanations clearer, let's assume we just created a Project with Bun for the backend and React+vite for the frontend, Redis for caching and PostgreSQL as our app's database

<div class={'w-full flex justify-center items-center'}>
  <Image src={ProjectExample} alt='Project example'/>
</div>

After you create a **Project**, you can create **Deployments** which will belong to the **Project**. You can think of deployments as virtual machines that will your application, but is not exactly a single machine.

<div class={'w-full flex justify-center items-center'}>
  <Image src={DeploymentExample} alt='Deployment example'/>
</div>

Each deployment consist of a virtual machine that runs the Diploi core process in charge of communicating with our main server along with Docker containers for each component and add-on that your project has.

  <Image src={DeploymentContainers} alt='Deployment container structure'/>
</div>

So when you launch deployments, you are creating a new virtual machine for your project, so you can have different deployments for multiple stages of your application.

</div>
