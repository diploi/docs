## What is a Diploi Project?

A Diploi project contains the deployments of your application. A typical setup could be one deployment for production, one for staging and perhaps one development instance per active developer.

A project is defined by the components and add-ons. A project also connects to a GitHub repository and contains common settings and environment variables.

## Components and Add-ons

Every project is started from a set of components and add-ons you choose, which defines the infrastructure of your project.

### Components

You can think of components as the application layer of your project. In Diploi you can have multiple options available to define your application, which you can mix as wish.

### Add-ons

Now that you understand components, you might need a way to persist data or a way to do pub/sub actions, which is where add-ons come in. Add-ons provide services that can be used by your application.

## Features of a Project

### Name

The project name can be chosen freely but will be used as a template for both deployment
names and hostnames so choosing a good short one can be a good idea.

### Components and Add-ons settings

Depending on your combination of components and add-ons there might be some configurable options. E.g. if a database should be running, Redis enabled etc. Values provided in the project are defaults that you can override in the deployment.

### Environment Variables

For your project specific configurations and secrets, you can add environment values.

Values provided in the project are defaults that you can override in the actual deployment.


### Repository

The easiest way to set up a project is to let Diploi bootstrap a new GitHub repository for
you. This will ensure that the repository contains the right files to make the project run.

Optionally you can create the project by connecting it to an existing repository. This can be
useful for example if you want to share a repository between multiple cores or projects.
In this case however, you are responsible for ensuring that the repository is set up for the
chosen project type.

## Deleting a project

When you no longer need a Project it can be deleted. However you need to delete all deployments
first and wait for the deletion to complete.
