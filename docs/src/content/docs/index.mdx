## What is Diploi?

Diploi is a platform and workflow for managing and hosting your full application.
No more context switching, local dependencies or configuration hell.


## How it works

Diploi uses a component-driven architecture to build your application, which can then have addons that can be attached to your component setup.

### Components

**Components** are the basic building blocks in Diploi, a component is defined by a framework and the concern they handle, like frontend, backend or fullstack. You can combine multiple components in a single deployment, which Diploi configures as a monolith application for you. 

##### Components available

###### Fullstack
- Next.js
- Astro
###### Frontend
- React + Vite + Typescript
###### Backend
- Node.js
- Bun

### Add-ons

**Add-ons** are additional services that your application will be using like a database, cache server or a message broker.


#### Supported add-ons
##### Databases
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Redis
