## What is Diploi?

Diploi is a platform and workflow for managing and hosting your full application from zero using some of the most popular frameworks and databases, without having to setup virtual machines, worrying about deployment pipelines, struggling with SSL certificates, configuring load balancers and other DevOps pains. No more context switching, local dependencies or configuration hell.

## Key Features

- Launch consistent staging, development and production deployments with only a few clicks
- Run stateful as well as stateless projects
- Onboard new team members with only a few clicks
- Develop without installing or keeping anything locally
- Super easy way of trying out different software stacks

:::note
Diploi is currently best used as the starting point to launch new applications, but you can host an existing project with Diploi.

## How it Works

Diploi uses a component-driven architecture to build your application. You can pick and choose your stack from a constantly growing list of components and add-ons. The selection is stored in a file in your project, so modifying the stack is as easy as editing a file.

### Components

**Components** are the basic building blocks of Diploi, a component is defined by a server/framework and the concern they handle, like frontend, backend or fullstack. You can combine multiple components in a single deployment, which Diploi configures in a monorepo for you.

### Add-ons

**Add-ons** are additional services that your application will be using like a database, cache server or a message broker.
