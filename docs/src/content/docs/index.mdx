## What is Diploi?

Diploi is a platform and workflow for developing and hosting your full application supporting 
popular frameworks and databases.

Use Diploi for

- Developing, testing and hosting just about any kind of web application
- Quick prototyping of new products
- Trying out new technology stacks with close to zero setup time

If you started your project on a vibe-coding platform and need better team support, version support and possibility to code using Cursor etc. Diploi could be what you are looking for.


## Key Features

- Launch consistent staging, development and production deployments with only a few clicks
- Develop without installing or keeping anything locally. 
- Onboard new team members in only a few clicks
- Supports a wide range of projects - from a simple website to a complex service with databases and microservices



### Supported Frameworks and Databases

Diploi supports a wide (and growing) range of frameworks and databases, including:

<ComponentList/>

<AddonList/>

## Prerequisites

The only thing you need to use Diploi is a **GitHub account** and a **Web Browser**.

Many prefer to use their locally-installed VSCode or Cursor IDE instead of the browser-based IDE. 
In that case you need to add your SSH key to Diploi in order for remote access to work.

## How it Works

Diploi uses a configuration-in-code approach to spin up every deployment as a separate single-node Kubernetes cluster 
(Don't worry, you need zero Kubernetes knowledge to use Diploi). Diploi takes care of hostnames, SSL certificates, 
building and updating Docker images for each service and making it easy to code right on the cluster, aiming for
the best possible DX.

Diploi works best when you set up your project as a monorepo, where the code for every component lives in a
 separate folder. If you are interested in more details and reasons for these choices, please see [Technical Deep Dive](/reference/technical-deep-dive/)


## Get started

The easiest way to learn Diploi is by launching a new application. For a quick walkthrough [Get Started](/get-started/) here, no registration needed.
