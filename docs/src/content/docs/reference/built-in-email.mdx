description: Use Diploi's internal SMTP relay for development-friendly email delivery.
---

Diploi provides a lightweight SMTP relay inside every deployment so your applications can send email without provisioning an external provider.
The service is intended for development and low-volume operational notifications.   
The SMTP relay is included with your deployment at no additional cost.

## Connection details

Connect using these values:

- Host: `core.diploi`
- Port: `2525`
- Authentication: Not required

:::note
This SMTP relay is only reachable from processes running inside your Diploi deployment network. External services cannot connect.
:::

### Example configuration

```ts
import nodemailer from "nodemailer";

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
	host: "core.diploi",
	port: 2525,
});

await transporter.sendMail({
	to: "user@example.com",
	subject: "Verify your email",
	text: "Click the link in the email to verify your account.",
});
```

## Component integration

The Supabase component automatically points its email authentication workflows at this relay, giving you out-of-the-box email confirmation flows without additional configuration.

## Usage limits

:::caution
The relay enforces strict rate limits to keep the service reliable for all tenants.
:::

- Maximum 10 messages per hour
- Maximum 30 messages per day
- Contact support if you need higher throughput

## Header normalization

To protect deliverability, Diploi rewrites certain email headers. These headers are stripped if present:

- `from`
- `to`
- `sender`
- `reply-to`
- `return-path`
- `resent-from`
- `resent-to`
- `resent-sender`
- `bcc`
- `cc`
- `errors-to`
- `x-original-from`
- `x-envelope-from`

Diploi sets the `from` address to your project's default domain for every message.

## Best practices

- Use the relay for development and staging workloads; production-grade email should use a dedicated provider once you outgrow the limits.
- Keep transactional content concise to avoid hitting daily limits.
- Reach out to support if you need custom limits or additional deliverability controls.
