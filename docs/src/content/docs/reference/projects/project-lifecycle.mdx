## Creating a Project

This is the first step to deploy a new application using Diploi. To create a project you must:

1. Select the stack of components and add-ons that your application will be using
2. Choose between creating a new repository to store your application's code or launching without a repository associated for testing purposes

Every project is started from the set of components and add-ons you choose and this defines the structure of your project.

### Components

You can think of components as the application layer of your project. In Diploi you can have multiple options available to define your application, which you can mix as you wish.

### Add-ons

Add-ons provide services used by your application. In general, add-ons in Diploi are services that do not require direct development work, which can be services like databases, analytics services, CMS dashboards, etc.

:::note
Services are not exposed publicly by default. They can only be accessed by the components in your project.

### Previewing your Project

In this section, you can see a preview of your monorepo folder structure at root level.

:::note
From the preview, you can rename the folders that contain your components and the add-on names that your application will be using, by clicking on the element you want to edit

### Choosing Between Creating a Project with or without a Repository

A **Project with a repository** is the default way to set up a project, Diploi bootstraps a new GitHub repository for you and generates a scaffold for your app based on the Stack you choose. additionally Diploi creates a CI/CD pipeline so changes can be persisted across multiple environments and allows your project to be launch in Staging and Production.

A **Project without a repository** used when you want to test a Stack or you want to run a simple scripts and apps online without a repository.

:::caution
Once you choose between using a new repository or launching without a repository, you will not be able to change the repository or add a repository.
:::

:::note
**Using an existing repository and importing an application to Diploi** is not yet an automagically process, but it is possible. If you would like to bring your existing application to Diploi, contact us on <a href="https://discord.gg/vvgQxVjC8G" target="_blank">Discord</a> or [via email](mailto:hello@diploi.com).

## Managing a Project

After creating a project, you will be able to create new deployments and modify the options of the project.

### Project Deployments

You will be able to create deployments. Each deployment represents a cluster that serves your application online. For a deeper dive on deployments, check the article about [Deployments](/reference/deployments/deployment).

### Project Options

In this tab you can view and edit properties of your project.

#### General

From here you can update the project's name inside Diploi. When you launch new deployments, the new deployment's name will start by using the project's name.

<ImageToPNG src={ProjectOptionsGeneral} alt='Project options general'/>

:::note
If you update the name of your project, it won't affect the repository's name.
:::

#### Parent Domain

By default, Diploi generates a domain for your application. The basic structure of a generated domain uses the following logic:

```
<Deployment endpoint>.<Project parent domain>.diploi.app
```

<ImageToPNG src={ProjectOptionsDomain} alt='Project options parent domain'/>

:::tip
If you want to set up a custom domain, you can do it from each deployment. For more information, click here [Deploying / custom-domain](/deploying/custom-domain/)
:::

## Deleting a Project

When you no longer need a Project you can delete it by first deleting all deployments within the project and the going to the "options" tab of your projects and look for the actions sections, to delete the project click on the "delete project" button.
