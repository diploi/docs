## What is a Diploi Project?

A Diploi project contains the deployments of your application. A typical setup could be one deployment for production, one for staging and perhaps one development instance per active developer.

A project is defined by components and add-ons. A project also connects to a GitHub repository and contains common settings and environment variables.

## Project types

### Production Project (Git Repository)

When you choose to create a new project with a new repository, you will be able to launch a new deployments from different branches of your repository, allowing you to have different environments online at the same time without having to configure servers manually.

By default, when you create a new project, a development deployment will be started, which you can use to start developing your application right away and will be active for 12 hours. This development deployment will use your repository's default branch main branch as its source.

:::note
If you want to create a new project with a repository, you can do so by following the steps in our [Creating a Project](/deploying/creating-a-project) guide.

### Temporary Project (Quick Launch)

With a Temporary Project or Quick Launch, you get a ready-to-use development deployment that you can use to test new technologies, frameworks, or just to try out Diploi without the need to create a repository.

You can create a Quick Launch project by choosing the "**Quick Launch**" repository option when creating a new project or from the homepage.
