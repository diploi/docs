## What is a Diploi Project?

A Diploi project contains the deployments of your application. A typical setup could be one deployment for production, one for staging and perhaps one development instance per active developer.

A project is defined by components and add-ons. A project also connects to a GitHub repository and contains common settings and environment variables.

## Project types

### Project with Repository

When you choose to create a new project with a new repository, you will be able to launch a new deployments from different branches of your repository, allowing you to have different environments online at the same time without having to configure servers manually.

By default, when you create a new project, a development deployment will be started, which you can use to start developing your application right away and will be active for 12 hours. This development deployment will use your repository's default branch main branch as its source.

:::note
If you want to create a new project with a repository, you can do so by following the steps in our [Creating a Project](/deploying/creating-a-project) guide.
:::

### Project Without a Repository

When starting a project without a repository, you get a development environment that you can use to test new technologies, simple scripts, cron jobs, or just to try out Diploi without the need to create a repository.

:::caution
When you start a project a without a repository, **you cannot add a repository later**. Which is why we do not recommend it for projects meant for production.
:::

:::caution
**Projects without a repository** are **not intended for production**, as your code will only exist on the deployment launched, and changes will not be persisted to other deployments you launch within the project.
:::

You can create a project without a repository by clicking on the "**Launch Without a Repository**" option inside the "GitHub Repository" section, when creating a new project.
