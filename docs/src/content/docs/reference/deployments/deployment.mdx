## What is a Diploi Deployment?

In Diploi, a deployment is a full instance of your application, including databases and
other services. It also includes storage and current code changes you are working on. In simple terms, a deployment is a virtual machine instance that runs your code.

***

## Deployment Types

Deployments in Diploi are divided into two general categories, dynamic development deployments and built deployments.

### Dynamic development deployments

In Diploi are deployments used for remote development, these have persistent storage for your code so that code changes will stay even if your deployment restarts or shutdown.

### Build deployments

In Diploi can be _**Staging**_ or _**Production deployments**_  and their virtual machine instances will run the production build of your application.
