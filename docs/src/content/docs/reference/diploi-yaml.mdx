title: diploi.yaml Explained
description: A deployment is a full instance of your application.
---

The `diploi.yaml` file at the root of a Diploi repository is the **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** configuration file Diploi uses to build the infrastructure for a deployment.   
Our component-based model allows for easy configuration of stacks without making the config overly verbose.
The more detailed config for a component, such as HELM charts and other setup files, are housed in dedicated GitHub repositories maintained by the component owners.

```yaml
diploiVersion: v1.0
components:
  - name: Next.js
    identifier: next
    package: https://github.com/diploi/component-nextjs#main
    env:
      include:
        - *
  - name: Bun
    identifier: bun
    package: https://github.com/diploi/component-bun#main
    env:
      include:
        - postgres.*
  - name: Node.js
    identifier: node
    package: https://github.com/diploi/component-nodejs#main
    env:
      include:
        - postgres.POSTGRES_USER:DB_USER
addons:
  - name: PostgreSQL
    identifier: postgres
    package: https://github.com/diploi/addon-postgres#main
```

## `components` and `addons`

The list of components and addons to be included in a project. Everything in this list can be edited and your infrastucture will adapt.

### `name`

The display name for a component. 

### `identifier`

An internal identifier for a component. **This has to be unique.**   
The identifier is used as the internal hostname for a component, and as the folder name where the component files are located.

:::caution
  The component identifier has to match the folder name it is stored in. If you change one, make sure to change the other too.
:::

### `package`

The URL for the package repository.
Version comes after the hashtag `#` symbol. Version can be a Git tag or branch reference.

### `env`

ENV values from other components aren't available by default, but can be configured here.
Importing an ENV variable means making it available for processes inside of a component.


```yaml
env:
  include:
    # Imports every ENV value from every component
    - *
    # Imports all ENV values from a component with the `postgres` identifier
    - postgres.*
    # Imports all ENV values that start with `POSTGRES_` from a component with the `postgres` identifier
    - postgres.POSTGRES_*
    # Imports all ENV values from all components where an identifier starts with `post`
    - `post*`
    # Imports the `POSTGRES_USER` ENV value from a component with the `postgres` identifier
    - postgres.POSTGRES_USER
    # Imports the `POSTGRES_USER` ENV value from a component with the `postgres` identifier and renames it to `DB_USER`
    - postgres.POSTGRES_USER:DB_USER
```

#### `import`

A list of ENV values available for processes inside of this component.

You can use wildcards when importing values.
- `*`
  - Imports every ENV value from every component
- `postgres.*`
  - Imports all ENV values from a component with the `postgres` identifier
- `postgres.POSTGRES_*`
  - Imports all ENV values that start with `POSTGRES_` from a component with the `postgres` identifier
- `post*`
  - Imports all ENV values from all components where an identifier starts with `post`
- `postgres.POSTGRES_USER`
  - Imports the `POSTGRES_USER` ENV value from a component with the `postgres` identifier

You can remap individual ENV values while importing them
- `postgres.POSTGRES_USER:DB_USER`
  - Imports the `POSTGRES_USER` ENV value from a component with the `postgres` identifier and renames it to `DB_USER`
