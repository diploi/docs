description: Feature roadmap and upcoming improvements for Diploi
---

Here is a short list with item we are currently working on. 

### Improved project import

Basic support for importing and running existing GitHub repositories was recently added. We now support **Lovable** and 
some basic **NodeJS** projects.

The idea is to gradually expand this support to be able to run as many types of tech stacks as possible, 
preferably without any configuration. Expect improvements on a monthly basis. Just running any kind of existing 
repository is a little more tricky for us than eg. Railway or Netlify since we also need to run the system in 
development preferrably with hot-reloading and all other development specialties working.




### Custom components


Custom components will allow power users to create and fine-tune their own components in order to run technologies 
not currently supported by Diploi. Dipli components and add-ons are based on Helm charts, so this will provide a 
lot of flexibility.

**Interested in early access?** If you need this capability now, we might be able to make special arrangements. 
Please contact us at [hello@diploi.com](mailto:hello@diploi.com).

### Inline components

We intend to make it possible to include a component's configuration directly in your source repository, 
allowing for tight control on exactly how the cluster is configured. This will also be useful for component
editors.


### Vertical scaling

This will make it possible to use Diploi for applications with more traffic than a single-node cluster can 
handle, it will also improve availability and reliability.

### Community Requests

We're tracking feature requests from our community. Here are the most requested features:

1. **Multi-language support** - Support for more programming languages
2. **Database migrations** - Automated database schema management
3. **CI/CD integration** - Built-in testing and deployment pipelines
4. **Team management** - Advanced collaboration features
5. **Monitoring & Analytics** - Built-in application monitoring
