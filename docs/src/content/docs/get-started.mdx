## Using Diploi

When you launch a new Project using Diploi, you get a repository in your GitHub account, which is fully configured. All you need to launch a new Project, is to sign up using a Github account.

***

## Launching a new application

When you register, you get access to [the Diploi dashboard](https://console.diploi.com/ "to the Diploi dashboard") which allows you to create projects where you can collaborate with your team, connect to remote development environment, and create development, staging, and production deployments.

### Test-driving Diploi

You can try out Diploi without registering, by using the **Quick Launch** feature from the homepage, which allows you to start a deployment in seconds, which you can access directly using our browser IDE. Start a Quick Launch deployment by visiting [diploi.com/#StackBuilder](https://diploi.com/#StackBuilder).

### Using Diploi for Production

To get started using Diploi for Production apps, you need to create a Diploi account. Since Diploi is tightly integrated with GitHub, you will need a GitHub account to be able to register. To register, go to [console.diploi.com](https://console.diploi.com) and
authenticate using your GitHub account.
