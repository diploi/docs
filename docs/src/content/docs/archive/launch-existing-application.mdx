## Ways to start using Diploi 

You have two ways to get started
* [**Quick launch**](#quick-launch) if you want only want to test drive Diploi and don't want to create an account just yet, or

* [**Dashboard launch**](#dashboard-launch) available when you create an account and gives you access to all features available in Diploi

:::caution
**Quick Launch** projects are **not intended for production**, as your code will only exist on the deployment launched, and changes will not be persisted to other deployments you launch within the project.

#### Prerequisites

* A GitHub account
* Text Editor - We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* An SSH Key (for development) - See [Add an SSH Key](/building/add-ssh-key/)
