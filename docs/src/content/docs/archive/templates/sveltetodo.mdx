This template features a simple starter ToDo application template implemented with
SvelteKit.

SvelteKit is a modern framework for building web applications, leveraging the innovative
Svelte compiler approach. It simplifies development by writing less code, which gets
compiled to highly efficient, imperative code that directly updates the DOM. SvelteKit
offers server-side rendering, static site generation, and full-stack capabilities,
enabling developers to create fast, scalable, and interactive web experiences with ease.

Features

- Full TypeScript support
- Postgres 14.1 database (optional) with out-of-the-box DB connection
- HMR support
- CRUD API with SvelteKit form actions.
