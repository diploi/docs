## Starter Kits

Starter Kits are complete, pre-configured templates, which can be used as a scaffold to start new applications or to use directly as they are, which you can launch instantly on Diploi. Each starter kit includes a `diploi.yaml` file, Dockerfiles for development and production, and a ready-to-run codebase..

<ElementList type={'starter'}/>

:::note
Starter Kits are different from the Stack Builder. The Stack Builder scaffolds a new project from individual [components](/building/components) and [add-ons](/building/add-ons). Starter Kits provide a complete, working application you can build on.

You can extend all Starter Kits available with additional components and add-ons.
