description: Host Ghost to publish blogs and newsletters with Diploi.
---

Ghost is an open-source content platform for publishing blogs, newsletters, and membership sites. Use this component when you want Diploi to manage builds and deployments for a Ghost site. It keeps your content workflow together with the infrastructure that serves it.

## Add to your project

Paste this entry into the `components` list in `diploi.yaml` to add Ghost to your project.

```yaml
components:
  - name: Ghost
    identifier: ghost
    package: https://github.com/diploi/component-ghost#main
    env:
      include:
        - mariadb.MARIADB_HOST:database__connection__host
        - mariadb.MARIADB_USER:database__connection__user
        - mariadb.MARIADB_PASSWORD:database__connection__password
```

:::note
- identifier must match the folder name you use for this component in your repo.
- Your project must have a MariaDB instance, [click here for more info](/building/add-ons/mariadb).
- In Diploi, Ghost uses MariaDB for storage, so you need to add a MariaDB to your deployment and use the environment variables as defined here:

```yaml
env:
  include:
    - mariadb.MARIADB_HOST:database__connection__host
    - mariadb.MARIADB_USER:database__connection__user
    - mariadb.MARIADB_PASSWORD:database__connection__password
```
