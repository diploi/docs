SvelteKit combines Svelte's component model with server-side rendering, routing, and adapters. Use this component when you need a fast Svelte frontend that can fetch data server-side or run API endpoints. Diploi runs the build and deployment steps so your project ships with predictable infrastructure.

## Add to your project

Paste this entry into the `components` list in `diploi.yaml` to add SvelteKit to your project.

```yaml
components:
  - name: SvelteKit
    identifier: sveltekit
    package: https://github.com/diploi/component-sveltekit#main
    
```

:::note
- identifier must match the folder name you use for this component in your repo.
- You can import ENV from add-ons into components using env.include.

Example:

```yaml
env:
  include:
    - postgres.*
```
