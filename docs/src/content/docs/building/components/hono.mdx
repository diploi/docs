Hono is a tiny, high-performance web framework tuned for edge and serverless workloads. Choose this component when you need fast APIs or request handlers with minimal overhead. Diploi takes care of packaging and deploying so you can focus on routing and middleware logic.

## Add to your project

Paste this entry into the `components` list in `diploi.yaml` to add Hono to your project.

```yaml
components:
  - name: Hono
    identifier: hono
    package: https://github.com/diploi/component-hono#main
    
```

:::note
- identifier must match the folder name you use for this component in your repo.
- You can import ENV from add-ons into components using env.include.

Example:

```yaml
env:
  include:
    - postgres.*
    - redis.*
```
