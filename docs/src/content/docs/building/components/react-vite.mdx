title: React + Vite
description: Bundle React apps quickly with the React + Vite component.
---

The React + Vite component pairs Vite's fast bundler with a ready-to-serve React runtime. Use it when you need quick rebuilds, hot module reload, and a lightweight deployment target for frontend projects. Diploi handles the build pipeline so you can focus on UI work.

## Add to your project

Paste this entry into the `components` list in `diploi.yaml` to add React + Vite to your project.

```yaml
components:
  - name: React + Vite
    identifier: react-vite
    package: https://github.com/diploi/component-react-vite#main
    
```

:::note
- identifier must match the folder name you use for this component in your repo.
- You can import ENV from add-ons into components using env.include.

Example:

```yaml
env:
  include:
    - mongo.*
```
