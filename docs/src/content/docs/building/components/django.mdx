Django is a batteries-included Python framework for building secure, database-driven applications. Use this component when you need an admin interface, ORM, and templating system out of the box. Diploi provisions the deployment pipeline so you can focus on models and views instead of infrastructure.

## Add to your project

Paste this entry into the `components` list in `diploi.yaml` to add Django to your project.

```yaml
components:
  - name: Django
    identifier: django
    package: https://github.com/diploi/component-django#main
    # Optional:
    # env:
    #   include:
    #     - postgres.*
```

:::note
- identifier must match the folder name you use for this component in your repo.
- You can import ENV from add-ons into components using env.include.

Example:

```yaml
env:
  include:
    - mariadb.*
```
