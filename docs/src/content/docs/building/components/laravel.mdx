import { Code } from 'astro-expressive-code/components';
import {diploiElementList, extractElement} from '../../../../components/elementUtils'
export const AllElements = await diploiElementList()
export const laravelDetails = extractElement(AllElements,'laravel')
export const laravelPackage = `${laravelDetails.url}/${laravelDetails.versions.pop()}`

Laravel is a modern PHP framework with expressive routing, ORM, queues, and first-class testing utilities. Use this component when you want Diploi to run the build pipeline, publish assets, and keep your Laravel workloads updated without manually scripting servers.

## Add to your project

Paste this entry into the `components` list in `diploi.yaml` to add Laravel to your project.

<Code code={`components:
  - name: ${laravelDetails.name}
    identifier: ${laravelDetails.identifier}
    package: ${laravelPackage}
    # Optional:
    # env:
    #   include:
    #     - mariadb.*`} lang="yaml" />

:::note
- identifier must match the folder name you use for this component in your repo.
- You can import ENV from add-ons into components using env.include.

Example:

```yaml
env:
  include:
    - mariadb.*
```
