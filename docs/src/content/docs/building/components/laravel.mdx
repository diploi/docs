Laravel is a modern PHP framework with expressive routing, ORM, queues, and first-class testing utilities. Use this component when you want Diploi to run the build pipeline, publish assets, and keep your Laravel workloads updated without manually scripting servers.

## Add to your project

Paste this entry into the `components` list in `diploi.yaml` to add Laravel to your project.

```yaml
components:
  - name: Laravel
    identifier: laravel
    package: https://github.com/diploi/component-laravel#main
    # Optional:
    # env:
    #   include:
    #     - mariadb.*
```

:::note
- identifier must match the folder name you use for this component in your repo.
- You can import ENV from add-ons into components using env.include.

Example:

```yaml
env:
  include:
    - mariadb.*
```
