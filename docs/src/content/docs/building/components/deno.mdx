import { Code } from 'astro-expressive-code/components';
import {diploiElementList, extractElement} from '../../../../components/elementUtils'

Deno is a secure JavaScript and TypeScript runtime with batteries-included tooling and standards-based APIs. Use this component when you want Diploi to manage cache-friendly builds and keep Deno services updated without self-hosting.

## Add to your project

Paste this entry into the `components` list in `diploi.yaml` to add Deno to your project.

<Code code={`components:
  - name: ${denoDetails.name}
    identifier: ${denoDetails.identifier}
    package: ${denoPackage}`} lang="yaml" />

:::note
- identifier must match the folder name you use for this component in your repo.
- You can import ENV from add-ons into components using env.include.

Example:

```yaml
env:
  include:
    - postgres.*
    - minio.*
```
