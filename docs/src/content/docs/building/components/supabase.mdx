description: Deploy Supabase edge functions and services using Diploi components.
---

Supabase bundles Postgres, real-time listeners, storage, and auth with edge functions. Use this component when you want Diploi to manage Supabase deployments alongside the rest of your stack so you can ship a unified backend without wiring infrastructure by hand.

## Add to your project

Paste this entry into the `components` list in `diploi.yaml` to add Supabase to your project.

```yaml
components:
  - name: Supabase
    identifier: supabase
    package: https://github.com/diploi/component-supabase#main
    # Optional:
    # env:
    #   include:
    #     - postgres.*
```

:::note
- identifier must match the folder name you use for this component in your repo.
- You can import ENV from add-ons into components using env.include.

  include:
    - redis.*
