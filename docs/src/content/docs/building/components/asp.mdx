ASP.NET is Microsoft’s open-source web framework for building modern, high-performance web apps and APIs with .NET. Choose this component when you’re shipping server-rendered sites, REST backends, or full-stack applications that benefit from the .NET ecosystem and tooling. Diploi handles the build/publish pipeline and runs your ASP.NET app as a service with the runtime and networking it needs.


## Add ASP.NET to an existing project

Paste this entry into the `components` list in `diploi.yaml` to add ASP.NET to your project.

<Code code={`components:
  - name: ${aspDetails.name}
    identifier: ${aspDetails.identifier}
    package: ${aspPackage}`} lang="yaml" />

:::note
- identifier must match the folder name you use for this component in your repo.
- You can import ENV from add-ons into components using env.include, depending on the db your project uses.

Example:

```yaml
env:
  include:
    - mariadb.*
    - minio.*
    - mongo.*
    - postgres.*
    - redis.*
```
