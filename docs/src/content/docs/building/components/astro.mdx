Astro is a modern static site builder focused on shipping minimal JavaScript to the browser. Choose this component when you are delivering content-heavy marketing sites, blogs, or documentation that benefit from fast page loads. Diploi handles the SSR build pipeline and pushes assets where they need to run.

## Add to your project

Paste this entry into the `components` list in `diploi.yaml` to add Astro to your project.

```yaml
components:
  - name: Astro
    identifier: astro
    package: https://github.com/diploi/component-astro#main
    
```

:::note
- identifier must match the folder name you use for this component in your repo.
- You can import ENV from add-ons into components using env.include, depending on the db your project uses.

Example:

```yaml
env:
  include:
    - mariadb.*
    - minio.*
    - mongo.*
    - postgres.*
    - redis.*
```
