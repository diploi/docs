description: Deploy lightweight Flask services on Diploi without custom infra.
---

Flask is a minimalist Python framework for APIs, dashboards, and microservices. Use this component when you want Diploi to handle the build steps, gunicorn/uvicorn configuration, and deployments while you focus on routes and extensions.

## Add to your project

Paste this entry into the `components` list in `diploi.yaml` to add Flask to your project.

```yaml
components:
  - name: Flask
    identifier: flask
    package: https://github.com/diploi/component-flask#main
    
```

:::note
- identifier must match the folder name you use for this component in your repo.
- You can import ENV from add-ons into components using env.include.

Example:

```yaml
env:
  include:
    - redis.*
```
