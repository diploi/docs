description: Deploy FastAPI services through Diploi’s managed component.
---

FastAPI is a modern, async Python framework that makes it easy to build performant APIs with automatic OpenAPI docs. Use this component when you want Diploi to run uvicorn builds and handle deploys so you can focus on type-safe endpoints and business logic.

## Add to your project

Paste this entry into the `components` list in `diploi.yaml` to add FastAPI to your project.

```yaml
components:
  - name: FastAPI
    identifier: fastapi
    package: https://github.com/diploi/component-fastapi#main
    
```

:::note
- identifier must match the folder name you use for this component in your repo.
- You can import ENV from add-ons into components using env.include.

Example:

```yaml
env:
  include:
    - mongo.*
```
