PostgreSQL is a popular relational database suited for transactional workloads and complex queries. Use this add-on when your application needs structured data storage with ACID guarantees.

## Add to your project

Paste this entry into the `addons` list in `diploi.yaml` to add PostgreSQL to your project.

```yaml
addons:
  - name: PostgreSQL
    identifier: postgres
    package: https://github.com/diploi/addon-postgres#main
```

:::note
- identifier must match the folder name you use for this add-on in your repo.
- Components can import ENV from this add-on using env.include. For example, a FastAPI component can pull Postgres connection variables like this:

```yaml
components:
  - name: FastAPI
    identifier: fastapi
    package: https://github.com/diploi/component-fastapi#main
    env:
      include:
        - postgres.*
```
