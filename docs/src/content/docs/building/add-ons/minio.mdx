title: MinIO
description: Provision MinIO as an S3-compatible Diploi add-on.
---

MinIO is an open-source, S3-compatible, object storage system that you can run in Diploi. Use this add-on when your components need to store uploads, backups, or other binary data without relying on an external cloud bucket.

## Add to your project

Paste this entry into the `addons` list in `diploi.yaml` to add MinIO to your project.

```yaml
addons:
  - name: MinIO
    identifier: minio
    package: https://github.com/diploi/addon-minio#main
```

:::note
- identifier must match the folder name you use for this add-on in your repo.
- Components can import ENV from this add-on using env.include. For example, an Astro component can expose the MinIO credentials like this:

```yaml
components:
  - name: Astro
    identifier: astro
    package: https://github.com/diploi/component-astro#main
    env:
      include:
        - minio.*
```
