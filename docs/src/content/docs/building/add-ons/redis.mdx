description: Add Redis for caching, queues, and ephemeral data in Diploi.
---

Redis is an in-memory data store ideal for caching, rate limiting, queues, and other latency-sensitive workloads. Choose this add-on when your components need fast key-value access or pub/sub messaging.

## Add to your project

Paste this entry into the `addons` list in `diploi.yaml` to add Redis to your project.

```yaml
addons:
  - name: Redis
    identifier: redis
    package: https://github.com/diploi/addon-redis#main
```

:::note
- identifier must match the folder name you use for this add-on in your repo.
- Components can import ENV from this add-on using env.include. For example, a Node.js worker can grab the Redis host and password like this:

```yaml
components:
  - name: Node.js
    identifier: nodejs
    package: https://github.com/diploi/component-nodejs#main
    env:
      include:
        - redis.*
```
